### PROJECT PLANNER

This application was built in order to understand the basic core concepts of JS Object Oriented Programming: Manipulating DOM Object elements, parsing element data, passing method references, moving DOM elements,getting element box dimensions,working with elements box positions, and loading dynamic scripts. Also using event listeners in order to add drag and drop functionality.This application also helped me understand JS classes, constructor functions and the this keyword.

### Usage

This application is not intended to be used on a regular basis, the main concept behind it is to get a deeper understanding in working with classes and object oriented programming with javascript.
